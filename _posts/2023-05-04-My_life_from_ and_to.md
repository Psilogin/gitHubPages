## Education

When Education is made as basic necessity, the world of education becomes a businness. Business only aims for the profits, not the well being of the consumers since you can't make money with the quality you make but quality you show. This leads to the inflation of the education price which leads the society away from advancement required and leads towards advancement shown by the businessmen they profit from.
