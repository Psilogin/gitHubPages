title: About ME
---

  I'm a Mechanical Engineering Graduate and i've worked in the field of CAD for 3 years.
During these 3 years i gave utmost to the work but, the pay grade is much low compared to the peers of my age, who are working in the field of Information Technology.
I am happy despite what I make compared to my friends and I Love what I am doing......?

  I am eldest son of a below middle class father, who worked his whole life for the better life. I had a goal that i should learn in IIT but, i have to continue my job for my brothers education.
Some may say, 'one can learn anything, anywhere, anytime if he or she has the zeal', but it is a corporate world where there are millions of gradutes coming out every year and to keep your job you have work as the one above likes. I've worked 14 hours a day 9 to 11 every day for 2 years which made me distant from dream of becoming an IITian.

While I am half dead, the people around me judge, by what I have and what I make. I'm earning the bare minimum I need to pass the day in other State, my parents watch others children making money and taking their parents in cars and gifting jewellery. This makes parents praise them infront of us making us feel inferior and unfilial. This made dissapointment on my self, added to the worries about the future cost inflation of necessities and housing (A long last dream for a middle class people). Then I realized, that **IT is a Big Baloon once you get on you reach hights(money) you never imagined but, you don't know when it will fall**.

  So, I was influenced by the life of a IT engineer and quit my job to find my way into IT. Realization doesn't get you job, skills does. I've got coaching from a half bake institute that shows jobs as moon in the grasp of our hands. The only way to get a well paid job as our friends does is to close the experince gap by fillers(fake), and I followed the path of predecessors of career change, and uploaded a modified resume of some previous batch senior in all the employment websites that are know to the human. While attending the interThen comes the day where the Tech giants play the game layoff's. Now Heavens above the head are far and the Earth below the feet is the only thing you have.
  
  **A**t the end, I still don't have a job after a year. I forgot what learnt in the mean time and the peace of mind to learn the skills that are on-demand. When I gain the interest to learn skills, I got enlightened to the fact that every skill has it's cost and if you want learn through free sources you should spend time you don't even imagine speding on completing a game.
  
All I can do is pray the GOD "Give me chance to see the hights and thrive for a better life". 

All of this happened in the life of a single adult who hasn't even spent quarter of life, and the **world population is 8 Billion**. Every person has story of his survival and every survival is great to one self.
In the process I learned : **Fight for the survival till the last step and till the last breathe. Life's value is by how long you survive and not how you survive.**
This what I learned till now, which may change in the future I don't know, but I hope that live a life I don't regret.

This is my first blog or maybe my thoughts I accumulated and stuffed in my head all these years.
I don't know If some reads but, It is my life and I should know myself to better myself.
