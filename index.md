## My journey form-and-to

  I'm a Mechanical Engineering Graduate and i've worked in the field of CAD for 3 years.
During these 3 years i gave utmost to the work but, the pay grade is much low compared to the peers of my age
who are working in the field of Information Technology.
I was not afraid of the wage gap betwwen my friends and me since i'm doing what 'I LOVE'.

  I am eldest son of a below middle class (don't want to hear poor) father with two son's, who worked his whole life for the better life unlike him. I used to have a goal that i should learn in IIT since my graduation years but, it cost more for my brothers college and the fee for the education is more for my brother compared to mine, which is why I've continued my job until him completing education.
 
  Some may say 'one can learn anything, anywhere, anytime if he or she has the zeal', but it is a corporate world where there are millions of gradutes coming out every year and if you want to keep your job you have work as the one above you likes. I've worked 10 hours a day 9 to 11 every day for 2 years which made me distant from dream of becoming an IITian.
  
  Now all my relatives ask "How much are you earining?". When I reply, they judge me as incompetent and didn't do well in my studies that is why I was paid less. I wonder who will tell them that if you want to earn more in field of mechanical in india, you need more experience before you graduate. If you have less than 3 years you'll be considered a "FITTER" with highest degree, and if you got the job as fresher, they'll expect you to know everything that is know to them. If you don't know you are seen as waste which has got jobs by some recommendation. If you say you are not taught that in the college, you are treated as a person who makes reason for not learing. I wish someone tell these experienced people that the people teaching in the colleges are the reminants of the gradutes and post gradutes who has not got a job and it is an alternative to drag the days. If a Lecturer has the ability the colleges which look beautiful from the outside were only for the outside. There are around 4500+ engineering colleges and only some of them have the capability to produce a fill fledged enginner.
  
  So, I was influesnced by the life of a software engineer  and quit my job to find my way into IT. This is where i joined an institute which shown me the job in my hand and it disapeared the minute I paid the fee. Then I got to know that all institutes are sham, they don't have jobs in their lockers to give a job the minute you pay the fee. And i've completed my coaching and ready for my job hunt and then the ballon called "IT" which was flying high suddenly lost it's air which made me one of the crabs in the bicket looking for an escape the bucket and become employed.
  
  At end I still don't have a job after a year but, the goal "Sofware job" is a moon in the sky which can be seen in the grasp of the hand but afar. In the mean time One's self become more anxious about future and make look for ways to relieve the burdens. When I got distracted I realized and made up my mind to get some more skill and sharpen the skills i have but, i the material and the resources to master a skill cannot be found in the vast network called "internet". If you want to learn something from online you don't even know will be good enough to make you skilled.
  
  When Education is made as basic necessity, the world of education becomes a businness. Business only aims for the profits, not the well being of the consumers since you can't make money with the quality you make but quality you show. This leads to the inflation of the education price which leads the society away from advancement required and advancement shown by the businessmen profit from.
